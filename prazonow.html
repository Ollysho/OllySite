            <h1>PrazoNow Rebrand</h1>
            <div class="row">
                <p>PrazoNow is an automotive startup that I worked with. I came on as the Marketing intern but since it was a small startup, I was able to climb quickly to become the main UX/UI designer and Front End Developer for the company.</p>
                <p>The fun part about my time with PrazoNow was that I was involved in two large-scale redesign projects: the first was a simple logo update; and then the next was a complete company name change.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="pBreak"></div>
            
            <h2>Logo Redesign</h2>
            <div class="row">
                <p>The previous PrazoNow logo was very generic since it was made with a logo generator, it also had the unfortunate coincidence of looking like a car being broken in half. This was the exact opposite of ideal since the company focused on redefining mobility and making it easier.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h3>Old Logo</h3>
                    <img id="prazologo" src="img/showcase/ux/prazonow/oldLogo.png">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h3>My Logo Redesign</h3>
                    <img id="prazologo" src="img/showcase/ux/prazonow/newLogo.png">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <p>My approach to the new logo was simple; the company needed something unique and scalable. I wanted to create something that had more personality so I added in colour. The company also had plans to become more than just about cars so I wanted to lean away from something too focused on that.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="pBreak"></div>
            
            <h2>Name Change/Pivot</h2>
            <p>Shortly after the logo change, the company wanted to change its name. This project took more time but was definitely more rewarding. I took this as an opportunity to establish specific design conventions for the brand as a whole moving forward.</p>
            <p>The new name the company was evolving to was "BORROW", once again I wanted to lean away from something too clever or literal and create a logo that was simple to look at and digest. It was a chance to create something that was both fun to look at and eye-catching, I think the final product really achieved that.</p>

            <p>The next step was a style guide</p>
            
            <div class="pBreak"></div>
            
            <h2>Style Guide</h2>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>Style guides allow brand cohesiveness across multiple platforms and are a great tool to aid in scalability. As more designers or Front End developers come onto the team, they should all ideally have a reference sheet to make sure their work aligns with the companies aesthetic vision. This was the sheet I made.</p>

            <div class="pBreak"></div>
            
            <h2>Website Redesign</h2>
            <p>The website redesign also gave me an opportunity to add a more consistent colour scheme and design language to their online image. There were also a few general UX issues with the site such as users not understanding what the product actually was or how many cars were available through it.</p>
