                    <p>Mischief Ventured was a start up project that I worked on. The aim of the project was to lower the barrier for entry into Hollywood with a social network for entertainment professionals that would allow interaction between them. It was aimed at screenwriters, enabling them to sell their scripts directly to people who would want to bid on them. I was the UX Designer, General Project Manager and a member of the Front End Developement team.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>When I joined the project, quite a bit of work was already underway and fairly detailed mockups of the proposed finished product already existed so I felt that it was important to create a general style guide so everyone on the Front End team could be on the same page.</p>
