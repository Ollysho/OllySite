                <h1>Work With The Coach Redesign</h1>
                <p>Work With The Coach is an LA based Digital Marketing agency that works with celebrities in building their online brand and identity. I was hired to take their already existing website give them a new web presence.</p>
                <p>While I don't have any renderings of the old site, WWTC is very experienced in the social network aspect of digital branding but not as knowledgable in effective website strategies, so it had a few problems:</p>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>The Old Site</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It was built on Wordpress out of ease rather than necessity and as a result page load times were slow and interaction was clunky.</li>
                        <li>It was overly flashy but failed to give very much information.</li>
                        <li>It had a lot of bugs that resulted from putting a lot of arbitrary plugins together.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>My Goals</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To use ony the necessary tools, in order to avoid bloat.</li>
                        <li>While still being aesthetically pleasing, the web page needs to convey accurate and important information.</li>
                        <li>A design that puts forth an idea of class since the company represents celebrities.</li>
                    </ul>

            </div>
            <p id="wwtc-mockup-p">While they are only slightly different, all three iterations of the mockup follow the same clean and efficient design ideology.
            <br>
            In my opinion, The one page design is the most efficient for the little amount of information that needs to be portrayed, the site only serves one purpose: to inform.

                    <p>The company eventually did a pivot in their online image and went with another designer for their new webpage, the site is still accessible and useable below. </p>
